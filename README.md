# Cluster automation

Each folder has a README.md with the instructions about what you need to do.

The first code that you have to execute it's locate in **aws** folder. There you can find instructions to build the infrastructure where the cluster will run.

Then you should create the mongodb images in **mongodb/packer** folder and start the instances in **mongodb/terraform** folder.
